# eBay Site Template

I don't know anything about how eBay works, but it seems as though everything on needs to be minified. This project lets you write HTML and CSS normally, but then minifies it automatically.

## Getting Setup
* install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* clone this project
* run `npm install`
* run `npm start`

## App setup
* write all HTML in app/index.html
* write all CSS in app/styles.css
* everything will be combined and minified into dist/index.html
